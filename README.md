# Render Scheduler for Houdini + ODTools bat files
Simple render scheduler which I wrote to manage my Houdini renders while I'm out.

I'm using ODTools - brilliant plugin for Houdini coded by Oliver Hotz - so most of work has already been done.

ODTools prepare bat files for command line rendering so my script just queues up the execution of that .bat files. No multiple machines supported.
